At the eScience center, we believe that great emphasis should be put on requirements engineering in all our software development projects. This is because requirements engineering helps to ensure that the software we develop meets the needs of the users and stakeholders, thereby increasing the likelihood of project success and user satisfaction.\n"},{"_path":"/modules/requirement-engineering","_dir":"modules","_draft":false,"_partial":false,"_locale":"","title":"Requirement engineering","description":"Photo by TODO on Unsplash","category":"Module2","order":5,"author":"eScience Center","abstract":null,"thumbnail":"thumbnail-requirementsengineering.jpg","visibility":"visible","_type":"markdown","_id":"local_fs:modules:requirement-engineering:index.md","_source":"local_fs","_file":"modules/requirement-engineering/index.md","_stem":"modules/requirement-engineering/index","_extension":"md","plainText":"---\ntitle: Requirement engineering \ncategory: Module2\norder: 5\nauthor: eScience Center\nabstract: \nthumbnail: \"thumbnail-requirementsengineering.jpg\"\nvisibility: visible\n---\n\n\nPhoto by <a href=\"\">TODO</a> on <a href=\"https://csharp-station.com/Tutorial/CSharp/Lesson19\">Unsplash</a>\n  \n  \n"}]
