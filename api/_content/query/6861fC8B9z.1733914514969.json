[2] is series of 10 videos based on the book “Clean Code by Robert C. Martin”. Like Unit 2, [3] points to the Code Quality Chapter of the Turing way which convers enough details on the topic help you write a readable and will formatted code.  Reference [4] is an extra reference for Python programmers, which is quite common these days inside and outside the Center, it is a quick overview of PEP8 code.\n \n**To complete Unit 3, you are expected to:** \n\n - Read/watch the suggested [teaching material](http://localhost:3000/internal-training/readability-and-code-formatting/teaching_material) \n - Prepare a list of questions and a short reflection on the suggested material. This will be used for the discussions during the weekly consultation hours with the coach.  \n - Please send the list of questions to your coach one day before the weekly meetings.. \n\nTime expected to complete this unit: **4 hours**\n"}
