Using OSS libraries makes the developerâ€™s work easier avoiding the developers starting each time from scratch which is inefficient (long time to reach a stable software release) and lead to duplication of effort. One of the first tasks of RSE at the eScience center is to identify potential OSS libraries and use them appropriately. In Unit 1, we cover the basics of OSS libraries which hopefully will help you to make well-informed decisions about OSS libraries in your projects.\n"},{"_path":"/modules/oss-libraries","_dir":"modules","_draft":false,"_partial":false,"_locale":"","title":"OSS libraries","description":"Photo by TODO on Unsplash","category":"Module4","order":1,"author":"eScience Center","abstract":null,"thumbnail":"open-source-software-1.jpg","visibility":"visible","_type":"markdown","_id":"local_fs:modules:Oss-libraries:index.md","_source":"local_fs","_file":"modules/Oss-libraries/index.md","_extension":"md","plainText":"---\ntitle: OSS libraries \ncategory: Module4\norder: 1 \nauthor: eScience Center\nabstract: \nthumbnail: \"open-source-software-1.jpg\"\nvisibility: visible\n---\n\n\nPhoto by <a href=\"\">TODO</a> on <a href=\"https://csharp-station.com/Tutorial/CSharp/Lesson19\">Unsplash</a>\n  \n  \n"}]
