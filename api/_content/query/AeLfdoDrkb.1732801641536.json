Nowadays, computing resources can be classified according to the level at which the hardware supports parallelism, with multi-core and multi-processor computers having multiple processing elements within a single machine, while clusters and clouds use multiple computers to work on the same task. Developing skills to write parallel programs becomes essential to exploit the available computing power.\n"}]
