[1] Effective unit testing by Elliotte Rusty is a keynote at Devoxx 2017 and focuses on the “why” aspects of testing, it is more on how you improve the development process by testing. [2] points to the Testing Chapter of the Turing way which convers enough details on the topic to let you start with safely with testing in your research projects. Finally, [3] is Open Lecture by James Bach on software testing which is more provocative, and approach testing from practical point of view, it tells the story from the professional testers point of view, it highlights that software testing is not just a matter of writing a few unit tests but it is a profession it itself is, never thought of that way before listening to this talk might be beyond the scope of this unit. \n\n \n**To complete Unit 2, you are expected to:** \n\n - Read/watch the suggested [teaching material](http://localhost:3000/internal-training/modules/Software-testing/teaching_material) \n - Prepare a list of questions and a short reflection on the suggested material. This will be used for the discussions during the weekly consultation hours with the coach.  \n - Please send the list of questions to your coach one day before the weekly meetings.. \n\nTime expected to complete this unit: **4 hours**\n"}]
