[1] is talk given at The Lead Developer UK conference 2017, it explains potential conflicts that can arise during software development. Culture clashes can cause quite a bit of tension and frustration and could hamper the progress of the project. [2] is a lecture on Human Software Engineering explains how to survive, optimize performance, and thrive in the modern working environment. [3] is a podcast roundtable discussing the human factors that impact software engineering, from communication tools they use to the environment that they work. \n\nTo complete Unit 2, you are expected to: \n\n - Read/watch the suggested teaching material. \n\n - Prepare a list of questions and a short reflection on the suggested material. This will be used for the discussions during the weekly consultation hours with the coach.  \n\n - Please send the list of questions to your coach one day before. \n\nImportant: the proposed material includes hands-on assignments. Do try them and if you encounter issues you cannot solve, do share them with your coach. \n\nTime expected to complete this unit: **4 hours**\n"}]
