As main material for Unit 6, we suggest following the 2-hour Tutorial APIs for Beginners - How to use an API, by freeCodeCamp.org [1].  \n\n \n\nAs usual for those who prefer reading material, we suggest reading the book chapter General introduction and Design API patterns  [2]. Finally, for a quick introduction to understanding APIs, we suggest reading the Red HatÂ® Shares newsletter, Understanding APIs [3].  \n\nTo complete Unit 6, you are expected to: \n\n - Read/watch the suggested teaching material. \n\n - Prepare a list of questions and a short reflection on the suggested material. This will be used for the discussions during the weekly consultation hours with the coach.  \n\n - Please send the list of questions to your coach one day before. \n\nImportant: the proposed material includes hands-on assignments. Do try them and if you encounter issues you cannot solve, do share them with your coach. \n\nTime expected to complete this unit: **4 hours**\n"}]
