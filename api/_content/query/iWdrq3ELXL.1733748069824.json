The Introduction to Parallel Computing Tutorial given by the Livermore computing Center is an excellent introduction to the topics of this Unit [1]. This tutorial can be combined with the 20 minutes introduction to parallel programming: Performance aspects, by Mats Brorsson from University of Luxembourg [2].\n\nTo complete Unit 5, you are expected to:\n\n - Read/watch the suggested teaching material.\n\n - Prepare a list of questions and a short reflection on the suggested material. This will be used for the discussions during the weekly consultation hours with the coach.\n\n - Please send the list of questions to your coach one day before.\n\n - Practical hands-on for this unit are provided by the material used for eScience Center External Training program [4]. You can do the hands-on individually or join a the eScience Center external workshop. Check the eScience Digital-skills for the workshops schedule, contact the eScience Center Training  to check whether there is still space for you to join.\n\nTime expected to complete this unit: **4 hours**\n"}]
