[3] is talk where the speaker shares her experience with contributing to Cucumber, including making an early mistake (merging something that was not ready yet) and fixing it with the support of core maintainers, and still feeling welcome. You will learn how to find your project and contributions to start with, how to connect with the community to make sure your contributions are useful, and the many diverse types of contributions you can make.  \n\n\nTo complete Unit 3, you are expected to: \n\n - Read/watch the suggested teaching material. \n\n - Prepare a list of questions and a short reflection on the suggested material. This will be used for the discussions during the weekly consultation hours with the coach.  \n\n - Please send the list of questions to your coach one day before. \n\nImportant: the proposed material includes hands-on assignments. Do try them and if you encounter issues you cannot solve, do share them with your coach. \n\nTime expected to complete this unit: **4 hours**\n"},{"_path":"/modules/open-science-and-reproducible-research/teaching_material","_dir":"open-science-and-reproducible-research","_draft":false,"_partial":false,"_locale":"","title":"Teaching Material","description":"","type":"exercise","order":5,"_type":"markdown","_id":"local_fs:modules:Open-science-and-reproducible-research:teaching_material.md","_source":"local_fs","_file":"modules/Open-science-and-reproducible-research/teaching_material.md","_extension":"md","plainText":"---\ntitle: Teaching Material  \ntype: exercise\norder: 5\n---\n\n### **Teaching Material**\n\n- Open Science and Reproducible Research [OnlineTalk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE9jsXxI6No)\n- An Introduction to Reproducible Research Practices [WorkshopTalk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VjDM-XsoHUQ)\n- WHAT IS OPEN SCIENCE? | An introduction series to open science [Webinar](ihttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mVCDkhxxUgg) \n- Reproducibility and Open Science [OnlineTalk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VjDM-XsoHUQ)\n"}]
