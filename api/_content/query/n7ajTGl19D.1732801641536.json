Although this concept has been around for six decades, it is still extremely relevant and useful for todayâ€™s software developers, and one of the key programming principles. At the eScience center, we really encourage modularity in all our software development projects as it helps the center to increase re-usability across projects and cross scientific disciplines, which is a key to the eScience domain as a whole. \n"}]
