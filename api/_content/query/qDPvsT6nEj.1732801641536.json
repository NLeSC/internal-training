When systems are constructed from many components, the organization of the overall system—the software architecture—is the new design challenge. Software architecture design has been addressed in several ways including informal diagrams and descriptive terms, module interconnection languages, templates and frameworks for systems that serve the needs of specific domains, and formal models of component integration mechanisms.\n"},{"_path":"/modules/software-archtecture-design","_dir":"modules","_draft":false,"_partial":false,"_locale":"","title":"Software architecture design","description":"Photo by TODO on Unsplash","category":"Module1","order":4,"author":"eScience Center","abstract":null,"thumbnail":"software-architecture.jpeg","visibility":"visible","_type":"markdown","_id":"local_fs:modules:Software-archtecture-design:index.md","_source":"local_fs","_file":"modules/Software-archtecture-design/index.md","_extension":"md","plainText":"---\ntitle: Software architecture design\ncategory: Module1\norder: 4 \nauthor: eScience Center\nabstract: \nthumbnail: \"software-architecture.jpeg\"\nvisibility: visible\n---\n\n\nPhoto by <a href=\"\">TODO</a> on <a href=\"https://csharp-station.com/Tutorial/CSharp/Lesson19\">Unsplash</a>\n  \n  \n"}]
