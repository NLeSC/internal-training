\n- Writing research software involves a unique set of challenges and considerations. \n- Research software development is an iterative process, and adapting to emerging best practices and community standards is crucial for success. \n- Collaboration and open communication with colleagues and the research community are key to producing high-quality research software.\n\nNote: \n\nHere are some best practices to keep in mind when developing research software:\n1. **Plan and Design Carefully:**\n   - Start with a clear project plan and research goals.\n   - Design your software architecture thoughtfully, with modularity and scalability in mind.\n   - Document your software design, including data structures, algorithms, and dependencies.\n\n2. **Version Control:**\n   - Use a version control system (e.g., Git) to track changes and collaborate with others.\n   - Host your code on platforms like GitHub for easy collaboration and sharing.\n\n3. **Reproducibility:**\n   - Make your code and research environment as reproducible as possible.\n   - Document dependencies and provide setup instructions.\n   - Consider containerization with tools like Docker to encapsulate the environment.\n\n4. **Documentation:**\n   - Write clear and comprehensive documentation for your code.\n   - Include comments in the code to explain complex logic or algorithms.\n   - Use tools like Jupyter Notebooks for interactive documentation.\n\n5. **Testing:**\n   - Implement unit tests, integration tests, and validation tests to ensure your software works correctly.\n   - Use continuous integration (CI) to automate testing and catch errors early.\n\n6. **Performance Optimization:**\n   - Optimize critical parts of your code for efficiency.\n   - Use profiling tools to identify bottlenecks.\n   - Consider parallelization or GPU acceleration for computationally intensive tasks.\n\n7. **Data Management:**\n   - Implement data handling and storage best practices, including data cleaning and validation.\n   - Use appropriate data structures and databases for efficient data management.\n\n8. **Licensing:**\n   - Choose an open-source license that aligns with your project's goals (e.g., MIT, Apache, or GPL).\n   - Clearly specify the license in your project repository.\n\n9. **Collaboration:**\n   - Foster a collaborative environment by welcoming contributions from others.\n   - Use platforms like GitHub for issue tracking and pull requests.\n\n10. **Security:**\n    - Protect sensitive data and prevent security vulnerabilities.\n    - Keep libraries and dependencies up to date to address security issues.\n\n11. **User-Friendly Interfaces:**\n    - Develop user-friendly interfaces and command-line options.\n    - Consider creating graphical user interfaces (GUIs) for non-technical users.\n\n12. **Community Building:**\n    - Engage with the research community, present your work, and seek feedback.\n    - Consider publishing your code and datasets in repositories like Zenodo or Figshare.\n\n13. **Citation and DOI:**\n    - Assign a DOI to your software, making it citable in research publications.\n    - Encourage others to cite your work when they use your software.\n\n14. **Maintenance and Sustainability:**\n    - Plan for long-term maintenance and updates.\n    - Seek funding or support to ensure the sustainability of your research software.\n\n15. **Ethics and Compliance:**\n    - Ensure your software complies with ethical guidelines and legal regulations, especially when dealing with sensitive data.\n\n16. **Peer Review:**\n    - Consider submitting your software for peer review through platforms like the Journal of Open Source Software (JOSS).\n\n===\n\n<!-- .slide: data-state=\"standard\" -->\n\n## Research

It may specify whether the software can be used, copied, modified, or distributed.\n\n2. **Restrictions:** These are limitations placed on the user, such as restrictions on reverse engineering, decompiling, or using the software for specific purposes.\n\n3. **Usage Terms:** This section may include usage terms, such as the number of users or devices that can use the software, the duration of the license, and whether the license is transferable.\n\n4. **Distribution:** If the software can be distributed, the license may specify the conditions under which it can be shared or sold.\n\n5. **Modification:** If users are allowed to modify the software, the license might specify the terms for sharing those modifications, including whether they must be open source or can remain proprietary.\n\n6. **Attribution:** Some licenses require users to provide attribution to the original software developer in their own work.\n\n7. **Warranty and Liability:** This section outlines the warranty, if any, provided with the software. It may also specify the extent of liability of the software developer for any damages or issues arising from the software's use.\n\n8. **Termination:** The license may include conditions under which it can be terminated, such as non-compliance with the license terms.\n\n9. **Governing Law:** This indicates which jurisdiction's laws will govern the license agreement.\n\nCommon types of software licenses include open source licenses like the MIT License, Apache License, and GNU General Public License (GPL), as well as proprietary licenses used for commercial software. Each type of license comes with its own set of terms and conditions, ranging from highly permissive (e.g., MIT License) to more restrictive (e.g., some proprietary licenses).\n\nIt's essential to carefully read and understand the terms of a software license before using or distributing the software, as violation of the license terms can have legal consequences. Additionally, some licenses are not compatible with one another, so it's crucial to ensure that the software's licenses align with your intended use and distribution.\n\n\n===\n\n<!-- .slide: data-state=\"standard\" -->\n\n## Programming \n\n\n There are several programming paradigms, which are different approaches to writing code and structuring programs\n\n<div style=\"width: 50%; float: left\">\n\n- Procedural Programming\n - Object-Oriented Programming \n - Functional Programming \n - Declarative Programming\n - Logic Programming\n - Concurrent and Parallel Programming\n - Event-Driven Programming\n</div>\n\n<div style=\"width: 50%; float: right\">\n<img src=\"media/STEM-Research-software-writing12.png\" width=\"100%\">\n</div>\n\n<div style=\"float: left; clear: both; padding-left: 35%; padding-top: 3em\">\n<small>Photo by <a href=\"https://unsplash.com/@stephaniemoarr?utm_content=creditCopyText&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=unsplash\">xxxx</a> on <a href=\"https://unsplash.com/photos/person-holding-white-ceramic-mug-DGt9zA3Fr0g?utm_content=creditCopyText&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=unsplash\">xxxx</a></small>\n</div>\n\nNote: \n\n- Don’t get into religious programming discussion and attitude.\n- Choose based on what fits best\n  - Expressiveness\n  - Ease of use\n  - Eco-systems (libraries, tools for debugging, community)\n- Imperative Programming: In imperative programming, you provide explicit instructions for the computer to follow, specifying the sequence of steps to achieve a particular result. Languages like C, C++, and Pascal are often associated with this paradigm.\n- Procedural Programming: Procedural programming is a subset of imperative programming where code is organized into procedures or functions. It promotes code reusability and maintainability. C and Pascal are examples of languages that support procedural programming.\n- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP): In OOP, programs are structured around objects, which encapsulate data and behavior. Key concepts include classes, inheritance, and polymorphism. Java, C++, and Python are popular OOP languages.\n- Functional Programming (FP): Functional programming treats computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions and avoids changing state and mutable data. It relies heavily on functions as first-class citizens. Languages like Haskell, Lisp, and Erlang are associated with this paradigm.\n- Declarative Programming: In declarative programming, you specify what you want to achieve without detailing how it should be done. SQL, for example, is a declarative language used for querying databases.\n- Logic Programming: Logic programming is based on formal logic and rule-based systems. Prolog is a well-known logic programming language used for symbolic reasoning and knowledge representation.\n- Event-Driven Programming: This paradigm is common in GUI programming and systems where code responds to events or messages. Event-driven languages include JavaScript and Python (with libraries like Tkinter).\nAspect-Oriented Programming (AOP): AOP is a complement to OOP. It focuses on separating cross-cutting concerns (e.g., logging, security) from the main program logic. AspectJ is a popular AOP extension for Java.\n- Concurrent and Parallel Programming: These paradigms address multi-threading, parallel processing, and synchronization. Languages like Go, Erlang, and Java provide features for concurrent and parallel programming.\n- Meta-Programming: Meta-programming is a programming technique where code generates, modifies, or analyzes other code. It's often used in code generation and domain-specific languages.\n- Scripting: Scripting languages are designed for quick, dynamic, and interpreted scripting tasks. Python, Ruby, and - JavaScript are scripting languages commonly used for automation and web development.\n- Array Programming: Array programming emphasizes operations on entire arrays rather than individual elements. Languages like MATLAB and NumPy (Python library) support array programming.\n- Reactive Programming\n\n===\n\n<!-- .slide: data-state=\"standard\" -->\n\n\n## Programming Languages\n\n<!-- ![](media/STEM-Research-software-writing13.jpg)-->\n\n<div style=\"width: 50%;
