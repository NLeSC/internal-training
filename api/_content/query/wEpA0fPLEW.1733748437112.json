[2] is series of 10 videos based on the book “Clean Code by Robert C. Martin”. Like Unit 2, [3] points to the Code Quality Chapter of the Turing way which convers enough details on the topic help you write a readable and will formatted code.  Reference [4] is an extra reference for Python programmers, which is quite common these days inside and outside the Center, it is a quick overview of PEP8 code.\n \n**To complete Unit 3, you are expected to:** \n\n - Read/watch the suggested [teaching material](http://localhost:3000/internal-training/readability-and-code-formatting/teaching_material) \n - Prepare a list of questions and a short reflection on the suggested material. This will be used for the discussions during the weekly consultation hours with the coach.  \n - Please send the list of questions to your coach one day before the weekly meetings.. \n\nTime expected to complete this unit: **4 hours**\n"},{"_path":"/modules/readability-and-code-formating/teaching_material","_dir":"readability-and-code-formating","_draft":false,"_partial":false,"_locale":"","title":"Teaching Material","description":"","type":"exercise","order":3,"_type":"markdown","_id":"local_fs:modules:Readability-and-code-formating:teaching_material.md","_source":"local_fs","_file":"modules/Readability-and-code-formating/teaching_material.md","_extension":"md","plainText":"---\ntitle: Teaching Material  \ntype: exercise\norder: 3\n---\n\n### **Teaching Material**\n\n- Python Code Formatting: The Key to Efficient Readability[YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpHH6OiA3Wk)\n- Code Clean Series – based on the book “Clean Code by Robert C.
