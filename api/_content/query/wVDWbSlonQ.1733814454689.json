[1] is a very short video of Donald Knuth about the importance of Literature programming. [2] is a longer talk which stresses further the importance of literate programming and promotes a mind shift from documenting code to writing a book. The last reference is focused on the usage of notebooks in Data Science.  \n \n**To complete Unit 4, you are expected to:** \n\n - Read/watch the suggested [teaching material](http://localhost:3000/internal-training/readability-and-code-formatting/teaching_material) \n - Prepare a list of questions and a short reflection on the suggested material. This will be used for the discussions during the weekly consultation hours with the coach.  \n - Please send the list of questions to your coach one day before the weekly meetings.. \n\nTime expected to complete this unit: **4 hours**\n"},{"_path":"/modules/notebooks-and-literate-programming/teaching_material","_dir":"notebooks-and-literate-programming","_draft":false,"_partial":false,"_locale":"","title":"Teaching Material","description":"","type":"exercise","order":3,"_type":"markdown","_id":"local_fs:modules:notebooks-and-literate-programming:teaching_material.md","_source":"local_fs","_file":"modules/notebooks-and-literate-programming/teaching_material.md","_stem":"modules/notebooks-and-literate-programming/teaching_material","_extension":"md","plainText":"---\ntitle: Teaching Material  \ntype: exercise\norder: 3\n---\n\n### **Teaching Material**\n\n- Donald Knuth - Literate programming [origine](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTkXg2LZIMQ)\n- Literate Programming in the Large [Keynote](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Av0PQDVTP4A)\n- iStory in the Notebook: Data Science using Literate Programming â€¦[conferenceTalk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmLUcnu1Qi8), [paper](https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3173574.3173748)\n"}]
