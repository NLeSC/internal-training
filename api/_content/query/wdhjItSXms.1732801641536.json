If code is easy to read, it will be easy to understand and easy to debug, maintain and extend, [1] short video on the importance of code formatting. Writing complicated code is easy, writing simple code is harder and takes longer. Learning to make code readable/understandable is difficult for inexperienced developers because it can be difficult to quantify the differences between readable code and un-readable code.  \n"}]
