Human aspects are also vital to the successful completion of a software project. Human factors are nowadays part of mainstream software engineering education to elevate job satisfaction, improve performance, and increase productivity of software engineers. In Unit 2, we spend some time to reflect on these factors and their impact on the daily work of RSEs at the eScience center.\n"},{"_path":"/modules/human-aspects-of-software-engineering","_dir":"modules","_draft":false,"_partial":false,"_locale":"","title":"Human aspects of Software Engineering","description":"Photo by TODO on Unsplash","category":"Module4","order":2,"author":"eScience Center","abstract":null,"thumbnail":"thumbnail-haose.jpg","visibility":"visible","_type":"markdown","_id":"local_fs:modules:human-aspects-of-software-engineering:index.md","_source":"local_fs","_file":"modules/human-aspects-of-software-engineering/index.md","_stem":"modules/human-aspects-of-software-engineering/index","_extension":"md","plainText":"---\ntitle: Human aspects of Software Engineering \ncategory: Module4\norder: 2 \nauthor: eScience Center\nabstract: \nthumbnail: \"thumbnail-haose.jpg\"\nvisibility: visible\n---\n\n\nPhoto by <a href=\"\">TODO</a> on <a href=\"https://csharp-station.com/Tutorial/CSharp/Lesson19\">Unsplash</a>\n  \n  \n"}]
