[1] is a very short video of Donald Knuth about the importance of Literature programming. [2] is a longer talk which stresses further the importance of literate programming and promotes a mind shift from documenting code to writing a book. The last reference is focused on the usage of notebooks in Data Science.  \n \n**To complete Unit 4, you are expected to:** \n\n - Read/watch the suggested [teaching material](http://localhost:3000/internal-training/readability-and-code-formatting/teaching_material) \n - Prepare a list of questions and a short reflection on the suggested material. This will be used for the discussions during the weekly consultation hours with the coach.  \n - Please send the list of questions to your coach one day before the weekly meetings.. \n\nTime expected to complete this unit: **4 hours**\n"}]
