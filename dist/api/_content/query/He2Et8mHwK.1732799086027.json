[1] is a 5-hour course given by teamtreehouse.com and contains lectures and hands-on sessions. This will be the main material to study for unit 4.  \n\nWe provide extra references for those who like to read more in-depth material on the topic of Unit 3.  \n\nTo complete Unit 4, you are expected to: \n\n - Watch the suggested teaching material. \n\n - Prepare a list of questions and a short reflection on the suggested material. This will be used for the discussions during the weekly consultation hours with the coach.  \n\n - Please send the list of questions to your coach one day before. \n\nImportant: In this unit the proposed material [1] contains some hands-on assignments. It is crucial to pause the video and perform the hands-on work on your laptop. \nTime expected to complete this unit: **4 hours**\n"}]
