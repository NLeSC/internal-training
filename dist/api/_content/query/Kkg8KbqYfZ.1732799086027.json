Nowadays, computing resources can be classified according to the level at which the hardware supports parallelism, with multi-core and multi-processor computers having multiple processing elements within a single machine, while clusters and clouds use multiple computers to work on the same task. Developing skills to write parallel programs becomes essential to exploit the available computing power.\n"},{"_path":"/modules/performance-optimization-and-parallelization","_dir":"modules","_draft":false,"_partial":false,"_locale":"","title":"Performance optimization and parallelization","description":"Photo by TODO on Unsplash","category":"Module1","order":5,"author":"eScience Center","abstract":null,"thumbnail":"performance-optimization.jpeg","visibility":"visible","_type":"markdown","_id":"local_fs:modules:Performance-optimization-and-parallelization:index.md","_source":"local_fs","_file":"modules/Performance-optimization-and-parallelization/index.md","_stem":"modules/Performance-optimization-and-parallelization/index","_extension":"md","plainText":"---\ntitle: Performance optimization and parallelization \ncategory: Module1\norder: 5 \nauthor: eScience Center\nabstract: \nthumbnail: \"performance-optimization.jpeg\"\nvisibility: visible\n---\n\n\nPhoto by <a href=\"\">TODO</a> on <a href=\"https://csharp-station.com/Tutorial/CSharp/Lesson19\">Unsplash</a>\n  \n  \n"}]
