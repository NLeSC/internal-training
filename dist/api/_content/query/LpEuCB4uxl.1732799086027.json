The Introduction to Parallel Computing Tutorial given by the Livermore computing Center is an excellent introduction to the topics of this Unit [1]. This tutorial can be combined with the 20 minutes introduction to parallel programming: Performance aspects, by Mats Brorsson from University of Luxembourg [2].\n\nTo complete Unit 5, you are expected to:\n\n - Read/watch the suggested teaching material.\n\n - Prepare a list of questions and a short reflection on the suggested material. This will be used for the discussions during the weekly consultation hours with the coach.\n\n - Please send the list of questions to your coach one day before.\n\n - Practical hands-on for this unit are provided by the material used for eScience Center External Training program [4]. You can do the hands-on individually or join a the eScience Center external workshop. Check the eScience Digital-skills for the workshops schedule, contact the eScience Center Training  to check whether there is still space for you to join.\n\nTime expected to complete this unit: **4 hours**\n"},{"_path":"/modules/performance-optimization-and-parallelization/teaching_material","_dir":"performance-optimization-and-parallelization","_draft":false,"_partial":false,"_locale":"","title":"Teaching Material","description":"","type":"exercise","order":5,"_type":"markdown","_id":"local_fs:modules:Performance-optimization-and-parallelization:teaching_material.md","_source":"local_fs","_file":"modules/Performance-optimization-and-parallelization/teaching_material.md","_stem":"modules/Performance-optimization-and-parallelization/teaching_material","_extension":"md","plainText":"---\ntitle: Teaching Material  \ntype: exercise\norder: 5\n---\n\n### **Teaching Material**\n\n\nIntroduction to Parallel computing, Livermore Computing Center [Online Tutorial](https://hpc.llnl.gov/documentation/tutorials/introduction-parallel-computing-tutorial)\n\nthreading vs multiprocessing in python [Talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZnGRKFUU0c)\n\nPerforming Asynchronous I/O Bound Operations (Jeffrey Richter) [Talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hB0K1JWFoqs) \n\nProgramming Paradigms material proposed by the NLeSC external Training: intermediate Research software Development [online Material](https://carpentries-incubator.github.io/lesson-parallel-python/) \n\n"}]
