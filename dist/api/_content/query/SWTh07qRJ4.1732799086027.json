It is important to understand how different types of open-source and free software licenses work, and how you can use them in your research projects at the center. It is important to note here that the licensing policy of the center is to release all software under the Apache 2 license. In Unit 5 we look at what a few of the different licenses are, and how they work.\n"}]
