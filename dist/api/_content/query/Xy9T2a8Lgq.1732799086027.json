[1] is a talk published by Oracle learning and gives a good overview of software modularity and architectures.  [2] is the first lecture of course at University of Verginia, it explains many concepts on modular design what are the qualities of good modules, metrics of module quality-cohesion and coupling. [3] is a retrospective talk on the modularity theme, it includes a brief history of software modularity since its introduction, why it is useful and the good and the bad of modularity over its evolution. [3] is proposed as a further reading (extra-material) for RSE who want to reflect deeper on the software modularity. Similarly, reference [4] is extra-material focusing on Cohesion and coupling in python.  \n\n**To complete Unit 1, you are expected to:** \n\n - Read/watch the suggested [teaching material](http://localhost:3000/internal-training/modules/Modularity/teaching_material) \n - Prepare a list of questions and a short reflection on the suggested material. This will be used for the discussions during the weekly consultation hours with the coach.  \n - Please send the list of questions to your coach one day before the weekly meetings.. \n\nTime expected to complete this unit: **4 hours**\n"},{"_path":"/modules/modularity/teaching_material","_dir":"modularity","_draft":false,"_partial":false,"_locale":"","title":"Teaching Material","description":"","type":"exercise","order":3,"_type":"markdown","_id":"local_fs:modules:Modularity:teaching_material.md","_source":"local_fs","_file":"modules/Modularity/teaching_material.md","_stem":"modules/Modularity/teaching_material","_extension":"md","plainText":"---\ntitle: Teaching Material  \ntype: exercise\norder: 3\n---\n\n### **Teaching Material**\n\n- Software Modularity: Paradoxes, Principles, and Architectures [conferenceTalk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D37sb08SodU)\n- Modularity lecture university of Virginia [online Lecture](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q76mO3eI4qE)\n- Cohesion and coupling: write BETTER PYTHON CODE [[Part 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eiDyK_ofPPM), [Part 2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv5jhbSkqLE)] \n"}]
