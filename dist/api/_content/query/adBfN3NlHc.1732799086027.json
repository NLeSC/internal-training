Today, in the Big Data era, understanding the basic features of data structures is a key factor which will help you to write programs that perform well and that can scale. Often, when we propose new algorithms and implement them, we have the tendency to test the implementation on a small (toy) data set, which does not give an accurate idea on the computational complexity of these algorithms. Certain algorithms might lead to long computations time or even impossible to complete within reasonable time. A Better metric for measuring the amount of time and/or space required by an algorithm for an input of a given size (n) is the algorithm complexity. \n"},{"_path":"/modules/data-structure-and-algorithm-complexity","_dir":"modules","_draft":false,"_partial":false,"_locale":"","title":"Data structures and algorithm complexity","description":"Photo by TODO on Unsplash","category":"Module1","order":3,"author":"eScience Center","abstract":null,"thumbnail":"data-structure-algorithms.jpeg","visibility":"visible","_type":"markdown","_id":"local_fs:modules:Data-structure-and-Algorithm-complexity:index.md","_source":"local_fs","_file":"modules/Data-structure-and-Algorithm-complexity/index.md","_stem":"modules/Data-structure-and-Algorithm-complexity/index","_extension":"md","plainText":"---\ntitle: Data structures and algorithm complexity \ncategory: Module1\norder: 3 \nauthor: eScience Center\nabstract: \nthumbnail: \"data-structure-algorithms.jpeg\"\nvisibility: visible\n---\n\n\nPhoto by <a href=\"\">TODO</a> on <a href=\"https://csharp-station.com/Tutorial/CSharp/Lesson19\">Unsplash</a>\n  \n  \n"}]
