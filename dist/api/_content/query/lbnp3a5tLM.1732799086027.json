As main material for Unit 6, we suggest following the 2-hour Tutorial APIs for Beginners - How to use an API, by freeCodeCamp.org [1].  \n\n \n\nAs usual for those who prefer reading material, we suggest reading the book chapter General introduction and Design API patterns  [2]. Finally, for a quick introduction to understanding APIs, we suggest reading the Red Hat® Shares newsletter, Understanding APIs [3].  \n\nTo complete Unit 6, you are expected to: \n\n - Read/watch the suggested teaching material. \n\n - Prepare a list of questions and a short reflection on the suggested material. This will be used for the discussions during the weekly consultation hours with the coach.  \n\n - Please send the list of questions to your coach one day before. \n\nImportant: the proposed material includes hands-on assignments. Do try them and if you encounter issues you cannot solve, do share them with your coach. \n\nTime expected to complete this unit: **4 hours**\n"},{"_path":"/modules/api-design/teaching_material","_dir":"api-design","_draft":false,"_partial":false,"_locale":"","title":"Teaching Material","description":"","type":"exercise","order":5,"_type":"markdown","_id":"local_fs:modules:API-design:teaching_material.md","_source":"local_fs","_file":"modules/API-design/teaching_material.md","_stem":"modules/API-design/teaching_material","_extension":"md","plainText":"---\ntitle: Teaching Material  \ntype: exercise\norder: 5\n---\n\n### **Teaching Material**\n\n- APIs for Beginners - How to use an API,[freeCodeCamp.org](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZvSYJDk-us)\n\n- General introduction and Design API patterns [Book chapter](https://livebook.manning.com/book/api-design-patterns/chapter-1/)\n\n- What is API design?
