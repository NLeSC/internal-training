The fact that the thing that operates the machine (software) is the same kind of thing as the thing it operates on (data) is definitely one of the strengths of current computersystems and one of the main reasons why we can do such complex and powerful things with the combination of hardware and software.\n\nThe following blogpost discusses why this concept is so powerful: [Fundamental Concepts of Computing: Software is Data!](https://www.blackliszt.com/2014/04/fundamental-concepts-of-computing-software-is-data.html)\n\n## Software is a special type of data\n\nHowever for most practical purposes in most domains of scientific research (except maybe the domain of computer science) it is useful to make a distinction between the data that is software and other data. From now on, when we use the word data, we mean the kind fo data which is not software and which we use to store more static information.\n\n- Software is executable, data is not.\n- Data provides information or evidence, software provides a tool to do work on the data.\n- Software is a creative work, scientific data are facts or observations.\n- The lifetime of software is generally not as long as that of data.\n\n[Software vs Data](https://github.com/danielskatz/software-vs-data)\n\n[Software vs. data in the context of citation](https://doi.org/10.7287/peerj.preprints.2630v1)\n\n\n# The role of Research Software\n\nThe following piece was written after a workshop called \"The Future of Research Software\", held in the Netherlands in 2022.\n\nIt explores the different roles for research software in the research life cycle, strengthening the case for sustainable software.\n\n[Defining the Roles of Research Software](https://upstream.force11.org/defining-the-roles-of-research-software/)\n\n[Defining Research Software: a controversial discussion](https://zenodo.org/records/5504016): Summary Report of FAIR4RS Subgroup 3 activity and discussion\n"},{"_path":"/info","_dir":"","_draft":false,"_partial":false,"_locale":"","title":"Learning Objectives","description":"Obtain the skills and knowledge necessary to address the following questions:","type":"info","order":0,"_type":"markdown","_id":"local_fs:info.md","_source":"local_fs","_file":"info.md","_stem":"info","_extension":"md","plainText":"---\ntitle: Learning Objectives\ntype: info\norder: 0\n---\n\nObtain the skills and knowledge necessary to address the following questions:\n- What is the difference between \"research software\" and \"software in research\"?\n- What is the difference between software and data?\n- Why are these distinctions important and useful?
