### Background 
Coding is just one element of the research software lifecycle. Successful research software starts first with intensive interactions with the problem owners (domain scientists) and ends with reaching out to the potential users, and there are many phases in between. In this unit we hope to raise awareness among the RSEs of the importance of certain aspects which cover the entire research software lifecycle and will have a crucial impact on the success of a given research software.
