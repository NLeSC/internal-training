### Instructions 

For Unit 6, we selected a couple of references which will help you to acquire the necessary knowledge on API-design.  As main material for Unit 6, we suggest following the 2-hour Tutorial APIs for Beginners - How to use an API, by freeCodeCamp.org [1].  

 

As usual for those who prefer reading material, we suggest reading the book chapter General introduction and Design API patterns  [2]. Finally, for a quick introduction to understanding APIs, we suggest reading the Red HatÂ® Shares newsletter, Understanding APIs [3].  

To complete Unit 6, you are expected to: 

 - Read/watch the suggested teaching material. 

 - Prepare a list of questions and a short reflection on the suggested material. This will be used for the discussions during the weekly consultation hours with the coach.  

 - Please send the list of questions to your coach one day before. 

Important: the proposed material includes hands-on assignments. Do try them and if you encounter issues you cannot solve, do share them with your coach. 

Time expected to complete this unit: **4 hours**
