### Background 

For Unit 7, we selected a number of references which will help you go beyond just knowing the syntax of the language.
[teaching material 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pg3UeB-5FdA) is a talk given at a conference in 2017 which goes over the common programming paradigm and explains the similarities and the differences. 
[teaching material 2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ps8jOj7diA0) is the first lecture of course at Stanford university which aims to teach several programming languages. 
The lecture is a general introduction to the course, it stresses the intellectual value of learning a programming language which is to study the paradigm they represent, so do not focus on the details but more on how the lecturer makes the link between a language and its paradigm.
