### Instructions 

For Unit 1, we selected a couple of references which will help you to develop a good understanding of the principles of modular design. [1] is a talk published by Oracle learning and gives a good overview of software modularity and architectures.  [2] is the first lecture of course at University of Verginia, it explains many concepts on modular design what are the qualities of good modules, metrics of module quality-cohesion and coupling. [3] is a retrospective talk on the modularity theme, it includes a brief history of software modularity since its introduction, why it is useful and the good and the bad of modularity over its evolution. [3] is proposed as a further reading (extra-material) for RSE who want to reflect deeper on the software modularity. Similarly, reference [4] is extra-material focusing on Cohesion and coupling in python.  

**To complete Unit 1, you are expected to:** 

 - Read/watch the suggested [teaching material](http://nlesc.github.io/internal-training/modules/Modularity/teaching_material) 
 - Prepare a list of questions and a short reflection on the suggested material. This will be used for the discussions during the weekly consultation hours with the coach.  
 - Please send the list of questions to your coach one day before the weekly meetings.. 

Time expected to complete this unit: **4 hours**
