After completing unit 5 you will have acquired a basic concept of performance optimization and parallelization like speedup, scalability, Amdahl’s and Gustafson’s laws, how to design parallel programs, domain decomposition, synchronization, etc.

- **Understand Parallel Computing Architectures**: Learners will be able to describe the classification of modern computing resources based on hardware-supported parallelism, including multi-core systems, multi-processor machines, clusters, and cloud infrastructures.

- **Analyze Performance Optimization in Parallel Programming**: Learners will be able to identify key performance considerations in parallel programming and explain how to optimize programs to effectively utilize available computing power.

- **Apply Basic Parallel Programming Concepts**: Learners will be able to write and analyze simple parallel programs using insights from the Livermore Computing Center tutorial and Mats Brorsson's lecture, focusing on performance optimization and resource utilization.
