Unit 2 aims to raise your awareness about the fact that when you choose a programming language for your project, you are actually selecting a programming paradigm known this will help you to better design your code and take advantage of the feature of the programming paradigm.

- **Analyze Programming Paradigms**: Learners will be able to compare and contrast common programming paradigms by identifying their key characteristics, similarities, and differences.

- **Understand the Intellectual Value of Programming Languages**: Learners will be able to explain the intellectual benefits of studying programming languages by linking specific languages to the paradigms they represent.

- **Develop Critical Thinking Skills in Paradigm Application**: Learners will be able to evaluate the suitability of different programming paradigms for various problem-solving scenarios.

**Note**: It is advised that you develop more in-depth knowledge about the programming paradigm you will use during the project which is beyond the scope of this unit.
