### Instructions 

As an employee of the eScience Center a must-read document is the Netherlands eScience Center Guide [1], it contains a gentle introduction to projects and software development at the Center. The content of the guide goes beyond the scope of this unit. Certain topics listed briefly in the guide will be discussed in more detail in the following units. To broaden your knowledge on research software development in general we do encourage you to read two other references namely the Turing way [2] and the Sustain 2021 report [3].
